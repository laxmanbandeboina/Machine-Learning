Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence focused on the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn from and make decisions or predictions based on data.
Unlike traditional computer programming, where explicit instructions are provided to solve specific tasks, machine learning algorithms learn patterns and relationships directly from data.
